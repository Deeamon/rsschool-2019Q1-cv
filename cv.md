## Summary  
I graduated  Belarusian State University (faculty of radiophysics and computer technologies) with an emphasis in  an application programming. I'm working as engineer-programs at School of business of BSU about 2 years.   
I like working with code and learning new technologies. But there is one direction in which I fell in love - web development. I tried to learn frontend development on my own, but the study was much more difficult than I expected. After a week of studying at your school, I realized web technologies are not difficult, but exciting and interesting.  
I believe that your course will help me expand my knowledge of frontend development, add new skills and capabilities, and bring me closer to the dream of a new job. I really want to become a frontend developer and and I would like to work in this field in the future.  
There are many reasons why I was interested this school but the most important reason is studying of  frontend developer and real chance to exchange knowledge with participants . It would be great for me to gain this kind of experience.  
I think I'm the right candidate for your school. I am a sociable, diligent and determined person.
